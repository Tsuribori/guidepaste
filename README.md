## What's this?
Guidepaste is a clone of a site where users can post text and then easily share it with others. 
Users can also make accounts to keep track of the "pastes" they have made and to delete them.

## Dependancies
Guidepaste uses SQLite3 to store all information.

## Installation
The scripts must be allowed to write in the directory where they reside. The database is created when the first text is submitted or first account created.
Change error-reporting off from config.php if everything goes well. It is important that the webroot is the "public" directory as to prevent people from downloading the database.
